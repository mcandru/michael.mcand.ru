I just accidentally discovered that if you type `claude.md` into your web browser, it redirects you to the [Anthropic Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview). I have to say, that's a pretty nice touch by Anthropic! I had no idea that `.md` was a valid domain name. Turns out it's the [official TLD of Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.md).

I'm very tempted now to make some strategic `.md` domain purchases. It wouldn't be the first, I am the proud owner of [normi.ng](https://normi.ng/) and [mcand.ru](https://www.mcand.ru/) after all.

I immediately checked to see if [README.md](https://readme.md) was taken. Unfortunately, it looks like it redirects you to some ad-laden [promo code website](https://dealsbe.com/). It would make for a great docs site for [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). [michael.md](http://michael.md/) is sadly also unavailable, but it's probably for the best anyway. I think the nicest use case for a `.md` domain is essentially exactly what Anthropic are using it for, a quick link to the developer documentation for some tool or library you're working on.

**Note:** After writing this, I read Jim Nielsen's recent piece [Examples of Great URL Design](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/). Not quite about TLDs per-say, but still an interesting adjacent read for anyone who's interested.
