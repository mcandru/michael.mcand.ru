    <h2>How I Track What I Read</h2>
<p>The vast majority of what I re-read is either by an author I can remember, has a title
I can remember, and is still available on the internet. However, on ocassion, I'll get
caught out, and want to find an article on a topic I vaguely remember reading, with a title
that I cannot remember in the slightest. Sometimes, Googling will find the original,
other times it's a lost part of my reading history forever.</p>
<p>Last year I decided to do something about it, and invested an afternoon to figure a better
way to keep tabs on what I read. Here's what I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an article, either on my phone or computer</li>
<li>Save it to <a href="https://www.notion.so/mmcatcd/1ca10996d6eb492d805d8c3d3d08e9aa?v=805e06699fcb40b5abe944a9fdaefd27">a Notion database</a>, either with the <a href="https://www.notion.com/web-clipper">Notion Web Clipper</a></li>
</ol>

<p>on my desktop browser or the "Share" button in the browser on my Android.
3. Optionally add tags to the article in the Notion database, to make it more discoverable
(this I rarely do anymore to be honest)
4. Read the article in Notion. Add comments, highlights, and edits as I go
5. Some time in the future, I can search for the article I'm looking for, and read it,
even if the article is no longer available on the web</p>
<p>I'm sure far more sophisticated workflows exist, but I love this because it's frictionless
enough that I actually use it, gives me a single consistent reading experience via the
Notion app, creates my own copy of everything that I read, that I can keep forever, and
makes it incredibly easy to find in future if I need it again.</p>
<p>I have also had <a href="https://www.notion.so/mmcatcd/1ca10996d6eb492d805d8c3d3d08e9aa?v=805e06699fcb40b5abe944a9fdaefd27">my links database</a>
publicly available on my site for quite some time now. This is not intended to be really
public, it more just facilitates me to easily share a link with a friend to one of my
Notion copies of an article if I wish. I rarely if ever do this in practice though, so
maybe I'll make it private again in future.</p>
<p>I honestly don't think there's much in this workflow that I'd change, other than making
it easier for me to add tags when saving a link. The official Notion web clipper doesn't
support adding tags, and neither does the mobile browser "Share" option though, so I'll
probably have to live with that for now.</p>
