title: Moving from Handwritten To-Dos to Google Calendar Tasks

I'm not an organised person. I don't tend to have a great grasp of time. I forget my keys unless they're in my trouser pocket, and I forget events and obligations unless I'm reminded of them repeatedly. I haven't bothered to create a system to improve this—until now.

For a long time my "organisational system" has been a hand-written daily list of things that need to be done. If something needed to be done tomorrow, or even this week, I'd typically create a task in my task managing tool of choice (my workplace uses [Linear](https://linear.app/)). These tasks would inevitably get lost and were rarely completed unless they became problems, or I happened to remember them.

So I decided to pretty much entirely ditch the hand-written list in favour of Google Calendar tasks instead. This may seem incredibly simple, but it has made a genuinely huge impact on my life, and my organisation.

I really like Google Calendar tasks because:

- They include both a description and a time. If a task doesn’t need to be done today, I can figure out when it might make sense to slot it in instead.

- They appear in my calendar alongside meetings and other events, which makes it easier for me to find a block of time to complete the task.

- I’m notified when I’m scheduled to work on a task. This is very important to me because I rarely—if ever—check a backlog of tasks.

- A task remains in my phone’s notification display until I mark it as completed, constantly reminding me that it needs to be done.

- They’re really easy to reschedule. Other things come up a lot for me, and it's common to need to move a task. The low friction for rescheduling is really helpful to ensure the task doesn’t get forgotten entirely.

- I can create a task on my phone. As much as I like paper, I don’t always have it with me, but I almost always have my phone. If a task comes to mind, I can schedule it before I forget.

What I like most about Google Calendar Tasks is how they reduce the effort required to stay somewhat disciplined. It's been working really well for me so far. I appear to be more on top of the busy work of life, and I have more space in the brain for the stuff that I enjoy most.
