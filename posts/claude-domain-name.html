    <p>I just accidentally discovered that if you type <code>claude.md</code> into your web browser, it redirects you to the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview">Anthropic Claude Code docs</a>. I have to say, that's a pretty nice touch by Anthropic! I had no idea that <code>.md</code> was a valid domain name. Turns out it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.md">official TLD of Moldova</a>.</p>
<p>I'm very tempted now to make some strategic <code>.md</code> domain purchases. It wouldn't be the first, I am the proud owner of <a href="https://normi.ng/">normi.ng</a> and <a href="https://www.mcand.ru/">mcand.ru</a> after all.</p>
<p>I immediately checked to see if <a href="https://readme.md">README.md</a> was taken. Unfortunately, it looks like it redirects you to some ad-laden <a href="https://dealsbe.com/">promo code website</a>. It would make for a great docs site for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. <a href="http://michael.md/">michael.md</a> is sadly also unavailable, but it's probably for the best anyway. I think the nicest use case for a <code>.md</code> domain is essentially exactly what Anthropic are using it for, a quick link to the developer documentation for some tool or library you're working on.</p>
