# Pedagogy

This file serves as a note to document everything that I learn about the practice of teaching.

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough

## Checks for Pedagogy

Adapted from Grant Sanderson's fantastic talk, ["Math's pedagogical curse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxo6SA8Uc).

1. Does the lesson start with a motivating question?
2. Are new abstractions preceded with concrete examples?
3. Are core ideas given diagrams?

### 1. Does the lesson start with a motivating question?

In computer science, this could be framed as some problem to get a computer to do what you want it to.

### 2. Are new abstractions preceeded with concrete examples?

Start with the base case, and work *towards* the general case.

### 3. Are core ideas given diagrams?

Describe, explain, visualise. The more angles you view a concept from, the greater the chance is of **raising the ceiling and lowering the floor** of your exposition.

## Tenets

Adapted from [Intellectual Mathematics manifesto of teaching](https://intellectualmathematics.com/manifesto/). While less actionable than the **Checks** above, I think they're still very useful.

1. Students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them but rather out of a genuine desire to figure things out
2. We learn when we are challenged, when we push ourselves. If you're not stuck, you're not learning
3. The goal of teaching is independent thought

These axioms might seem a little antagonistic at first, so lets describe my interpretation of their meaning in some more detail.

### 1. Students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them

In a practical sense, this means that if you're a teacher, and you simply prescribe your students something to learn, they will not learn it well. Therefore, as a teacher, it is partially your job to convince them that it is of interest to them.

I have frequently heard that some subjects most enjoyed in education were not specifically because of the content, but of the teacher. The teacher alone convinced them that an otherwise uninterested subject was worth studying.

### 2. We learn when we are challenged

Richard Feynman once said "You must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool", when speaking of practicing science. The role of the teacher is to provide ways to test whether a student is fooling themselves in their understanding or not.

A teacher may provide clear lectures, and well thought-out tests, and these are important, and do help, but that does not mean that they are testing whether a student has fooled themselves or not.

I don't think that I necessarily agree entirely that you are not learning unless you're stuck though. Sometimes you're stuck because you're learning in the wrong way for you, and it could be much easier to learn from a different angle.

### 3. The goal of teaching is independent thought

Your students aren't going to be in college forever. They have come to learn how to gain knowledge, and apply it. Teaching should incentivise students to think independently. But, it should not necessarily require it. Some students may already be capable independent thinkers, other not quite.
